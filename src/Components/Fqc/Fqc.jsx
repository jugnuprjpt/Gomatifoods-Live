                <br /> <strong> Ans : &nbsp;</strong>Filtered oils are better than
                refined ones as they are less processed and treated hence have a
                higher value of nutrients in them. Refined oils are devoid of
                beta carotene, vitamin E and minerals. Filtered oils are only
                pure oil getting clean and filtered without any processing and
                no chemicals are added. On the other hand refined oil chemically
                bleached oil i.e. oil is being chemically processed and
                fragrance and chemical are added to it to make it look better
                and clearer. Therefore, Filtered oils are are far more better
                than refined oils as there are no chemicals added to filtered
                oil. Also groundnut oil is one of best oils that you can use on
                daily basis. Goundnut oil

                <br /> <strong> Ans :&nbsp;</strong>ur Groundnut oil has a strong
                flavor when smelt raw, but after cooking it doesn’t leave any
                unwelcome smell on food and actually enhances flavours. It can
                easily be used for cooking various dishes. You can use this oil
                for the purpose of shallow frying or even deep frying. This oil
                has a high smoke point and is a very versatile all-purpose
                cooking oil.

                Since it has a high smoking point, groundnut oil can be used to
                deep fry a variety of foods, especially Indian and Chinese. The
                formation of harmful substances occurs only beyond the smoking
                point to which groundnut oil takes a long time to reach. It is
                also reusable. It can be filtered and used several times. Since
                it has a neutral taste, it does not interfere with the core
                taste of the dish. Also, it does not absorb the taste of the
                ingredients, making reusability possible without an unnecessary
                overlapping of flavours. The reusability makes it
                cost-effective. It does not turn rancid easily and can be stored
                for long, provided it is kept in a cool, dark, dry place.

                <br /> <strong> Ans : &nbsp; </strong>Groundnut oil, especially if it is
                organic, is considered fairly healthy. The following are the
                health benefits of groundnut oil:

                </strong>
                <p>
                  Groundnuts contain 40 to 50 percent fat, and a tablespoonful
                  of the oil made from them contains 13.5 grams of fat. This fat
                  occurs in the form of different types of fatty acids such as
                  oleic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid, etc. Most of this is
                  unsaturated fat (both poly and mono) which is believed to be a
                  good, healthy source of fat. This reduces the risk of heart
                  disease and lowers bad cholesterol levels.

                  Groundnut oil contains absolutely no cholesterol and therefore
                  does not add unnecessary dietary cholesterol to our daily
                  consumption. Atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque
                  forms around the arteries and leads to thickening, can thus be
                  avoided. It also has a substance called resveratrol that
                  decreases blood pressure and reduces stress on the
                  cardiovascular system.

                  Antioxidants protect the body from toxins and free radicals.
                  Groundnut oil contains phytochemicals and vitamin E, both of
                  which are natural antioxidants. It also reduces inflammation
                  if consumed regularly. It is said to keep many diseases like
                  cancer at bay.

                <p>
                  The vitamin E helps maintain good skin health, making it look
                  young and healthy. It prevents premature aging, wrinkles, and
                  marks caused by free radicals.

                  Slows cognitive disorders
                </li></strong>
                <p>
                  Resveratrol in groundnuts, in addition to decreasing blood
                  pressure, also slows down cognitive disorders like dementia
                  and Alzheimer’s disease. Being an antioxidant, it prevents
                  free radicals from breaking down neural pathways in the brain,
                  thus stopping the progress of the disease. The antioxidants
                  present in groundnut oil are its greatest assets. If extracted
                  with the use of heat, these antioxidants may be damaged.
                  Cold-pressed oils, on the other hand, retain them.
